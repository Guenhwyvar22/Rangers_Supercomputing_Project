# supercomputing
Filled with progress and code for the supercomputing challenge. This is where we will store all our progress on code and other things as well.

Use this command to install packages:

pip install librosa pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

newer version of librosa doesn't work so uninstall the new one and replace it with the older version:

pip uninstall librosa

pip install librosa==0.9.2
